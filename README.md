# AT&T Integrated Cloud: Continuous Delivery

In the spirit of openess and collaboration, this repository is a collection of various scripts and tools that the average person may or may not find useful. It is not exactly what AT&T would use for internal CI, however it does includes scripts for public CI and/or for various demonstrations related to the [Openstack-Helm](https://github.com/att-comdev/openstack-helm) repository. For more details, please reference the README.md in each of the included folders.

Sincerely,

*AT&T Integrated Cloud Community Development Team*
