# Demonstration Scripts

These demonstration scripts are meant to be helpful guides in showing users how we bring up the [Openstack-Helm](https://github.com/att-comdev/openstack-helm) project. There are little nueances bringing up the environment, and in the spirit of openness and collaboration, we are sharing them with the rest of the community. We're not saying that they're pretty, or that they are meant to be anything beyond demonstration.

**WARNING:** Use at your own risk, and you may have to modify for your own environment.
