# AT&T Integrated Cloud: Continuous Delivery

AT&T is exploring the use of Travis-CI for Open Source projects. This project folder is where we will share these files before deploying them directly into the [Openstack-Helm](https://github.com/att-comdev/openstack-helm) repository.

Sincerely,

*AT&T Integrated Cloud Community Development Team*
